# Telco-Customer-Churn---Supervised-Learning

##Introduction To The Issues Raised
Telco companies are companies that provide landline services, Internet, online security, streaming TV and Movies, etc.
Telco companies have problems such as losing customers (Customer Churn), generally due to dissatisfaction with the services provided. Churn is calculated based on how many customers leave the service at one time.
This project helps to predict behavior to retain customers, as well as analyze what factors influence customers to leave the service used.
